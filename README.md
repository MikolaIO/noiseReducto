# noiseReducto
## This is a code I used in MSc to compare results of noise reduction with both spectral subtraction and neural network method. It uses modified vbelz U-Net model and modified vbelz code to generate .wav files.

### This was my way of learning convolutional neural networks in a somewhat practical way. It's still not perfect, the validation loss still leaves something to be desired, but I think it's a neat model.
